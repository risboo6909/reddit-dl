# reddit-dl
Reddit images downloader in Rust

Inspired by https://github.com/darkmtr/reddit-downloader

This is intended to be my first project which uses rust async capabilities to download images from Reddit fast.

## Usage

./reddit-dl --subr [name] --limit [number of images to download] (defaults to 50)
